# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This is a project from my coursework, which demonstrates that I am familiar with building data sets, training word embeddings (Word2Vec here), and building an LSTM model to predict user sentiment from reviews. I have built much more stronger foundation in NLP during my part-time employment as a data scientist and this a small example of what could be done.
